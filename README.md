# Junior-Research-Keypad
My code for my Junior Research Project. 
Also several other documents for it.
Word randomizer randomized the order of the prompts used.
fullDeviceCode.ino contains the code used on the device. The other folders are earlier versions.
This repo is a mess, it should probably be completely redone. I learned a lot about good repo management over the course of this project.
